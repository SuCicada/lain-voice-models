# lain-voice-models

## how you can use:
### Windows
(I specially make some jobs for running on Windows. Because if you use mac or linux, I think you have some programming skill, 
so you can find what you need in [SuCicada/so-vits-svc#DEV.md](https://github.com/SuCicada/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/DEV.md))

Now, I will tell you how to run Lain Voice on Windows.


1. make a empty dir, give it a name what you like.
1. download [venv.zip]() on the dir. ( it is the python runtime. don't worry, you don't need python skill.)
2. unzip the `venv.zip` 
3. download [so-vits-svc-4.0.zip](https://github.com/SuCicada/so-vits-svc/archive/refs/heads/4.0.zip) and put on same dir. (it is source code)
4. unzip the `so-vits-svc-4.0.zip`
5. download [models.zip]() on the dir. (it is models files)
6. unzip the `models.zip`
7. download [lain-voice.bat]() on the dir. (it is the starting program for running Lain)
8. now, your dir has 4 parts.
  - venv/
  - so-vits-svc-4.0/
  - models/
  - lain-voice.bat
9. now, You just need double click the `lain-voice.bat`.
10. the console will open, wait the program init over, the console will display a url like "http://127.0.0.1:17861",  open it on your browser.
11. over, enjoy it.


Sorry, it might be a little cumbersome, I didn't do the script, sorry 

I am tired, if you have any question. You can bravely give me issues, donâ€˜t afried. 
I am kind, give me issues if you want to new functions.
