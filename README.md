## how you can use:
### Windows
(I specially make some jobs for running on Windows. Because if you use mac or linux, I think you have some programming skill, 
so you can find what you need in [SuCicada/so-vits-svc#DEV.md](https://github.com/SuCicada/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/DEV.md))

Now, I will tell you how to run Lain Voice on Windows.


1. download https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bi6mgRuLh69EOOoaE_48ugKuQWZysDSn/view?usp=sharing
2. unzip lain-vits.zip, and open dir
3. now, You just need double click the `lain-voice.bat`.
4. the console will open, wait the program init over, it will automatically open new tab on the default browser.  
    if it not, the console will display a url like "http://127.0.0.1:7860",  open it on your browser.
5. over, enjoy it.
