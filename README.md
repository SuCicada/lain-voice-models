# lain-voice-models

## how you can use:
### Windows
(I specially make some jobs for running on Windows. Because if you use mac or linux, I think you have some programming skill, 
so you can find what you need in [SuCicada/so-vits-svc#DEV.md](https://github.com/SuCicada/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/DEV.md))

Now, I will tell you how to run Lain Voice on Windows.


1. make a empty dir, give it a name what you like.
2. download [venv.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oYZZ6ac8g0LdrVHwsZ-KXINqMkSp_xX4/view?usp=sharing) on the dir. ( it is the python runtime. don't worry, you don't need python skill.)
3. unzip the `venv.zip` 
4. download [so-vits-svc-4.0.zip](https://github.com/SuCicada/so-vits-svc/archive/refs/heads/4.0.zip) and put on same dir. (it is source code)
5. unzip the `so-vits-svc-4.0.zip`
6. download [models.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F9oRDJpWMQWiPZHTnSDfUbN3fdriohzQ/view?usp=sharing) on the dir. (it is models files)
7. unzip the `models.zip`
8. download [lain-voice.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuCicada/lain-voice-models/master/lain-voice.bat) on the dir. (it is the starting program for running Lain)
9. now, your dir has 4 parts.  
  - venv/
  - so-vits-svc-4.0/
  - models/
  - lain-voice.bat
10. now, You just need double click the `lain-voice.bat`.
11. the console will open, wait the program init over, it will automatically open new tab on the default browser.  
    if it not, the console will display a url like "http://127.0.0.1:7860",  open it on your browser.
11. over, enjoy it.


Sorry, it might be a little cumbersome, I didn't do the script, sorry 

I am a little tired now, if you have any question. You can bravely give me issues, donâ€˜t afried.   
I am kind, give me issues if you want to new functions.
